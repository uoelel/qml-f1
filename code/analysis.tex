\hypertarget{exercise-1-creating-plots}{%
\subsection{Exercise 1: Creating
plots}\label{exercise-1-creating-plots}}

The next three exercises below require you to read in a particular file,
filter/transform the data as needed, and create one or more plots that
appropriately illustrate the described aspects of the data. Please also
include a concise written description of the patterns you notice in each
plot you make.

\hypertarget{exercise-1.1}{%
\subsubsection{Exercise 1.1}\label{exercise-1.1}}

Based on \texttt{data\_e1\_1.csv}: Plot centered speech rate against f0
midpoint, distinguishing somehow between conditions, faceting by vowel.
Describe what you see.

\hypertarget{exercise-1.2}{%
\subsubsection{Exercise 1.2}\label{exercise-1.2}}

Based on \texttt{data\_e1\_2.csv}: Plot logged reaction times by
language, by environment, and by age. Describe what you see.

\hypertarget{exercise-1.3}{%
\subsubsection{Exercise 1.3}\label{exercise-1.3}}

Based on \texttt{data\_e1\_3.csv}: Plot the proportion of correct
responses for each trial in the easy and difficult conditions, faceting
by priming setting. Describe what you see.

\hypertarget{exercise-2-correcting-plots}{%
\subsection{Exercise 2: Correcting
plots}\label{exercise-2-correcting-plots}}

The following two plots are not appropriate for the type of data they
show. Briefly describe what is wrong with each plot, try to figure out
what the plots might be aiming to visualise, and write your own code to
create a more appropriate plot for the exact same data. If you're unsure
about the kind of data you're dealing with, having a look at the data
frame might help.

\hypertarget{exercise-3-choosing-appropriate-summary-measures}{%
\subsection{Exercise 3: Choosing appropriate summary
measures}\label{exercise-3-choosing-appropriate-summary-measures}}

Read in \texttt{data\_e3.csv} and obtain summary measures (central
tendency: mean, median, or mode; and dispersion: standard deviation or
range) for each variable in the data. Make sure to pick the correct
measure for the respective variable type.

Then, for each variable, briefly state the type of variable, the chosen
measures, and report the value of those measures.

\hypertarget{exercise-4-identifying-probability-distributions}{%
\subsection{Exercise 4: Identifying probability
distributions}\label{exercise-4-identifying-probability-distributions}}

For each of the variables in the table, specify in the
\texttt{Probability\ distribution} column whether it's (in principle)
distributed according to a Gaussian, log-normal, or Bernoulli
distribution, or according to a different one (put ``other'' in this
case).

If you have doubts about any of the variables, write about it briefly
below the table.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule()
& Variable & Probability distribution \\
\midrule()
\endhead
1 & Vowel duration (ms) & \\
2 & Formant values (hz) & \\
3 & Accuracy (binary) & \\
4 & Readability (0--100) & \\
5 & Reaction times (ms) & \\
6 & Scots vs English & \\
7 & Logged reaction times & \\
8 & Ratio of 1st vs non-1st pronouns & \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{exercise-5-contrast-coding}{%
\subsection{Exercise 5: Contrast
coding}\label{exercise-5-contrast-coding}}

Look at the following table that represents the coding of a categorical
predictor \texttt{background}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule()
& Bangladeshi & Mandarin & English \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Bangladeshi & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
Mandarin & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
English & 0 & 0 & 3 \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Assume that the intention was to use treatment coding, and to order the
levels according to R's default alphabetical order. Briefly explain what
is wrong with this table, and create a new table with the correct coding
scheme (you can use \url{https://tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables\#}
to format the table in markdown).

\hypertarget{exercise-6-running-a-bayesian-linear-model}{%
\subsection{Exercise 6: Running a Bayesian linear
model}\label{exercise-6-running-a-bayesian-linear-model}}

Imagine you've just run the following study:

\begin{quote}
Participants are asked to listen to nonce words and choose whether they
think the word refers to a small object or a big object. Half of the
words are of the \texttt{kiki} type (back consonants and high front
vowels), while half are of the \texttt{baba} type (front consonant and
low vowels). The expectation is that \texttt{kiki} words should elicit
more \texttt{small} responses and \texttt{baba} words more \texttt{big}
responses. The data also contains reaction time, and the expectation
there is that shorter reaction times would correlate with a greater
effect of hearing a \texttt{kiki} word vs a \texttt{baba} word.
\end{quote}

Read the \texttt{data\_e7.csv} file. It contains the following columns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{subject}: the subject's ID.
\item
  \texttt{response}: whether the subject has chosen \texttt{small} or
  \texttt{big}.
\item
  \texttt{condition}: \texttt{kiki} vs \texttt{baba} word.
\item
  \texttt{RT}: reaction time in ms.
\end{itemize}

Make sure to change columns to factors if needed and to specify the
order of levels.

Run a linear model that helps you answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Do \texttt{baba} words elicit more \texttt{big} responses than
  \texttt{kiki} words?
\item
  Is the effect of \texttt{baba} words on response greater with shorter
  reaction times?
\end{enumerate}

In code \emph{and} in a brief written description, report the model
specification and the results. Also include a plot of the model results.

\hypertarget{exercise-7-correcting-a-linear-model}{%
\subsection{Exercise 7: Correcting a linear
model}\label{exercise-7-correcting-a-linear-model}}

Imagine you are asked to review a paper. Below you can find the
description of a mock study, including the details of the linear model
the researchers have run. The results are not included.

\begin{quote}
We recorded 50 subjects while they read 100 sentences on a screen. For
each subject, half of the sentences were presented together with
pictures of natural landscapes. The other half was presented together
with pictures of urban landscapes. Background sounds were delivered via
headphones to the subject in each trial of the natural and urban setting
condition. For each setting (natural vs urban), half of the trials had
natural sounds (birds, waterfalls, wind, waves, thunders) and half had
urban sounds (traffic noise, sirens, people walking).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
For each trial we measured speech rate as number of syllables per second
(syl/s). The hypothesis is that speech rate will be faster in the urban
setting trials relative to the natural setting trials. Moreover, the
effect of background noise (natural vs urban sounds) will decrease
speech rate in the natural setting but not in the urban setting. In
other words, we expect the visual setting (natural vs urban) to prime
speakers to slow down their speech rate, but we expect the auditory
setting (natural vs urban) to make a difference only in the visual
natural setting.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
To assess these expectations, we ran a linear model using a Gaussian
distribution with visual setting (natural vs urban) as the outcome
variable. We included the following predictors: speech rate (centered)
and auditory setting (natural vs urban). In R syntax:
\texttt{brm(visual\ \textasciitilde{}\ speech\_rate\_c\ +\ auditory)}.
\end{quote}

Now, critique the analysis (i.e., explain what is wrong with it) and run
a more appropriate linear model to assess the research hypotheses of the
study based on the provided data (\texttt{data\_e8.csv}). Report the
model specification and the results of your linear model with respect to
the hypotheses.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Frequentist CIs and Bayesian CrIs have the same interpretation.

  The types of predictor variables in a linear model decide which
  distribution family to use in the model.

  Strip charts are among the plots that can be used to visualise the
  individual observations of a continuous variable.
\item
  All population-level effects returned by a model summary are
  conditional posterior probabilities.
\item
  95\% CrIs are more informative than 60\% CrIs.
\item
  Quantitative methods are objective.
\item
  The most appropriate distribution family for a binary variable is the
  Bernoulli family.

  About 68\% of the data in a Gaussian distribution is contained within
  the range marked by ``mean -- 1 SD'' and ``mean + 1 SD''.
\item
  \texttt{plogis(0.3\ +\ 0.2)} is equivalent to
  \texttt{plogis(0.3)\ +\ plogis(0.2)}.
\item
  The goal of statistics is to definitively accept or reject hypotheses.
\item
  When creating a density plot, the \emph{y}-axis can be interpreted as
  the absolute probability of obtaining a specific value.
\item
  The number of parameters to estimate in a Bayesian model is equivalent
  to the number of predictors in the model.
